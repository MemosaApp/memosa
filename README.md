## Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine is self-contained and does not require you to install
anything (for the rest of the app to function), however, you will need to install
neo4j in order to use the recommendation engine.

## Running tests

```
meteor npm run lint
```

## Feature tests

1. Make sure `meteor` is running
2. In another command line, run `meteor npm run chimp-tests` or `meteor npm run chimp-watch`.

## Using Atom?

apm install language-babel
apm install linter
apm install linter-eslint
```
