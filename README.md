## Getting Started

Welcome to the Memosa repo, lucky you! Here's some quick steps to get started!

1. Install Meteor
2. Install Yarn
3. `cp settings.example.json settings.json`
4. `npm run seed`
5. `npm start`
6. Check out [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Running the app

```
npm start
```

Then go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Running tests

* Run linter and tests with coverage: `$ yarn test`
* Run lint: `$ yarn run lint`
* Watch lint: `$ yarn run lint:watch`
* Run mocha tests once: `$ yarn run test:mocha`
* Watch mocha tests: `$ yarn run test:watch`
* Run coverage: `$ yarn run test:cover:mocha`

## Acceptance tests

1. Teardown your mongo database: `$ npm run teardown`.
2. Seed your mongo database: `$ npm run seed`.
3. Run Meteor in one terminal: `$ npm start`.
4. Run Chimp in another terminal: `$ npm run acceptance:watch`.

## Seeding

**HEADS UP!** Do NOT have Meteor running when you run these commands.

You can seed your database with a test account with notebooks using:

```
npm run seed
```

The test user is:

```
email: test@test.com
pass: testing
```

You can run the following command to clear your database:

```
npm run teardown
```
